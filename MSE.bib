@techreport{bentley2010,
abstract = {This report examines the potential of management procedures as a decision making tool for fisheries management in California. It was commissioned by the California Ocean Protection Council and the California Department of Fish and Game under a contract awarded to Quantitative Resource Assessment LLC. The report is broken into two parts. The first part, “Fisheries management procedures: an introduction” describes fisheries management procedures, their benefits and potential pitfalls. The second part, “Meta-evaluation: application to the California nearshore fishery” applies a newly developed approach to evaluating management procedures. This approach (“meta-evaluation”) has been developed as a means of more rapidly and efficiently evaluating management procedures. We applied meta-evaluation to the 19 species belonging to the California nearshore fishery. Acknowledgements},
