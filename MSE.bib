@techreport{bentley2010,
abstract = {This report examines the potential of management procedures as a decision making tool for fisheries management in California. It was commissioned by the California Ocean Protection Council and the California Department of Fish and Game under a contract awarded to Quantitative Resource Assessment LLC. The report is broken into two parts. The first part, “Fisheries management procedures: an introduction” describes fisheries management procedures, their benefits and potential pitfalls. The second part, “Meta-evaluation: application to the California nearshore fishery” applies a newly developed approach to evaluating management procedures. This approach (“meta-evaluation”) has been developed as a means of more rapidly and efficiently evaluating management procedures. We applied meta-evaluation to the 19 species belonging to the California nearshore fishery. Acknowledgements},

@book{Hilborn1992,
abstract = {This article aims to break new ground in academia by bridging the existing knowledge and practice gap on governance during conflict. It seeks to understand the governance dynamics during conflict in the non-government-controlled parts of Syria. It pays particular attention to civil society and state building processes. In doing so, the study spans historical and geographical width. Historically, to understand the roots of the conflict, it assesses the state-civil society-market dynamics of governance in Syria prior to 2011. Nevertheless, its focus is on contemporary Syria between March, 2011 and May, 2014. Geographically, its particular attention and in-depth analysis is on three areas in the non-government-controlled parts: Al-Raqqa (the city), Deir Ez-zor (Al-Mayadeen and the city) and Aleppo (the city).},
